# Passion Project: Game On

You just finished spending hours to add another game to your completed library collection. 
Having a hard time deciding what game to play next? Game On is a video game recommender 
designed to help you pick that next game to spend your valuable time on. 
 
Game On will recommend games based on previous games you have played, and you will be 
able to contribute to the ratings of the games. This recommender will incorporate a machine 
learning/prediction model. It will include a filter allowing results to be sorted by gaming 
console, genre, reviewer ratings and other criteria that factors into whether a person would 
play the game. 
 
This project will be done utilizing Python, Docker and Airflow to extract API data, 
transforming with Pandas, and loading in a SQL database afterwards. 
The front end will be created using Streamlit and hosted on Heroku.
